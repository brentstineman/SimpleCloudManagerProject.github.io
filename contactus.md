Please pardon the dust as we keep setting things up. This is an unfortunate side affect of striving to be "highly transparent". 

If you want to learn more about SCAMP you can:

<i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Follow us on Twitter via [@simplecloudmgr](http://twitter.com/simplecloudmgr "Simple Cloud Manager on Twitter")

We'll use twitter to announce changes/progress on the project and once we get to a point where its usable to help answer questions. 

<i class="fa fa-envelope-square"></i> Send mail to [simplecloudmgr@outlook.com](mailto:simplecloudmgr@outlook.com "Email Us")

If you don't want to let the entire world know you're reaching out to us, or simply can't put the message into 140 characters, we have an alternative.

## The Team
Like all open source projects, this is the effort of a team of folks that are doing this as their "real jobs" allow. If you'd like to speak to someone behind this effort, please feel free to reach out to any of us individually.
