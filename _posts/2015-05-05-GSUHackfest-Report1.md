*As part of the ongoing efforts to build SCAMP. We've been holding a hackfest with students from our first potential pilot customer, Georgia State University. Four of their students, Wasfi, Caleb, Shamari, Ram, have come to Redmond, WA to help us build the solution. Below is an initial write-up of their experiences. *

#####Guest Blog Post#####
Our first day in Redmond, Washington at Microsoft was a blast! All four of us were extremely excited to get started working with Microsoft and their team. Once we arrived on campus we were introduced to the development team and given a brief tour of the area. In our first impressions we noticed the area was much different than Atlanta. It was quite flat and there is not much in the area except for Microsoft. The campus however was amazing! There were upwards of 100 buildings surrounded by open fields and beautiful scenery. Our team was stationed at Building 20. Building 20 was an open space filled with TV’s and meeting rooms where developers collaborated and did their work. Once we got here the real work started. The Microsoft Team gave us an overview of the project and the vision we would be helping them work on. One thing we noticed in the talks with Microsoft’s Team is that in Software Engineering a lot of the work process derives from talking through problems and designing the best solutions for those problems as a team as opposed to everyone just being heads down coding, which we initially expected. The team lead delegated tasks and each team member was put in an area where they were strongest at and could be the most effective. 

Some highlights from our first two days include... 

- learned about Visual Studio Debugging
- helped design new user interface for SCAMP 
- contributed to storyboards describing how SCAMP would be used. 
- Discussed most efficient interface for users
- Caleb and Wasfi developed Dashboard and Group manager page for Scamp using tools like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
- Ram and Shamari shadowed senior developers and learned more about the .NET framework and ASP.NET vNext  

Can't wait to see what the next two days have in store!
