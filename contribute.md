This project is just getting going. And while all the code is up on GitHub, we're not quite ready yet to start accepting contributions. 

You can expect that we'll accept changes to both the project itself and this web site. However, we may ask you to agree to a contributor license. This is one of several details we're actively working to sort out.

Please check back soon as we'd love to have you join the fun.
