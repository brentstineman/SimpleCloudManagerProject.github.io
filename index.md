Welcome to the Simple Cloud Manager Project (SCAMP) !!

When dealing with the cloud, there are two common challenges:

1) Make it easy for a non-technical user to provision and access cloud resources. 

2) Provide some cost control measures to prevent billing surprises. 

To that end, we have created SCAMP as an open source solution. Our goal is as follows:

- Address the challenges above for Microsoft Azure subscriptions with a project that can be easily deployed by subscription owners to provide an "out of the box" solution
- Provide a reference implementation that takes advantage of the latest enhancements to Azure's Management API for those that want to build their own solution.
- Demonstrate how new Microsoft technologies can be combined with the latest Open Source innovations
- Be transparent and engage with the open source community

We hope you find this effort interesting and valuable and will possibly even join us in this journey.
